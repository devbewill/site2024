In this example we use a `flex` container within a `grid` div splitted in 10 columns.

The width of the sidebar is set to use 2 columns, while the content is set to start from column 4 and use all the space available.

```js
<main className="flex h-[200vh]">
  <div className="grid grid-cols-10 w-full">
    <aside className="self-start sticky top-10 col-span-2 bg-green-200">
      Mi sticky sidebar
    </aside>

    <div className="col-start-4 col-span-full  bg-violet-200">
      my awesome content
    </div>
  </div>
</main>
```
