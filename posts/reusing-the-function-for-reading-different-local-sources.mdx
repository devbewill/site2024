Imagine you have your React blog and all your posts are stored in a folder called `posts`, but you have a brilliant idea to add a new section to your site where you want to share your notes.
The most logical choice is to create a separate folder for the notes and keep the posts and notes separate.
Your folder tree should look something like this:

```
- posts
 - post-1.md
 - post-2.md

- notes
 - note-1.md
 - note-2.md
```

You can easily share the same code to be read in different folders without duplicating the same code in each page.
To do this, you can create a new page `getLocalData.tsx` in `/app/lib/` and write there the generic code for reading files.

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";

export function getLocalData(localFolder) {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(path.join(localFolder));
  const localFiles = files.map((filename) => {
    const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(
      path.join(localFolder, filename),
      "utf-8"
    );
    const { data: frontMatter } = matter(fileContent);

    return {
      meta: frontMatter,
      slug: filename.replace(".mdx", ""),
    };
  });

  // Sort posts by date in descending order
  const sortedFiles = localFiles.sort(
    (a, b) => new Date(b.meta.date).getTime() - new Date(a.meta.date).getTime()
  );

  return sortedFiles;
}
```

Now all you need to do is create your page or component to display your notes or posts and import `getLocalFiles`.
After that you can use it in your new component or page without forgetting to pass the folder you want to read as a parameter.

```javascript
//your Posts section

import Link from "next/link";
import { getLocalData } from "../lib/getLocalData";

export default function Lastposts() {
  const posts = getLocalData("posts"); // ðŸ‘ˆ the folder from which you want to read files

  return (
    <section className="posts">
      {posts.map((post) => (
        ...
      ))}
    </section>
  );
}

```

or

```javascript
//your Notes section

import Link from "next/link";
import { getLocalData } from "../lib/getLocalData";

export default function Lastposts() {
  const notes = getLocalData("notes"); // ðŸ‘ˆ the folder from which you want to read files

  return (
    <section className="notes">
      {notes.map((note) => (
        ...
      ))}
    </section>
  );
}

```
