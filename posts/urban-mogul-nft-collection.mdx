In the now remote January 2022 i was intrigued by the buzz surrounding NFTs and the enormous profits earned _by others_, so i decided to create my collection.
I used Figma to create 5000 JPGs, developed a Dapp for NFT minting using the code provided by [Hashlips](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_nft_minting_dapp), and hosted some of my NFTs on [OpenSea.io](https://opensea.io/collection/urbanmogulnft).

However, I did not create a real project behind it, my objective was to experiment with blockchain, NFTs, and Figma stack.

Anyone interested in buying my NFTs can still do so as they are available for minting again.ðŸ¤£
